                  are discouraged because of difficulty describing its usage when
                  embedded in APIs. 1. Ignored fields.  It includes many fields which
                  are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion and FieldPath
                  are both very rarely valid in actual usage. 2. Invalid usage help.
                  \ It is impossible to add specific help for individual usage.  In
                  most embedded usages, there are particular restrictions like, \"must
                  refer only to types A and B\" or \"UID not honored\" or \"name must
                  be restricted\". Those cannot be well described when embedded. 3.
                  Inconsistent validation.  Because the usages are different, the
                  validation rules are different by usage, which makes it hard for
                  users to predict what will happen. 4. The fields are both imprecise
                  and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise mapping to a URL. This
                  can produce ambiguity during interpretation and require a REST mapping.
                  \ In most cases, the dependency is on the group,resource tuple and
                  the version of the actual struct is irrelevant. 5. We cannot easily
                  change it.  Because this type is embedded in many locations, updates
                  to this type will affect numerous schemas.  Don't make new APIs
                  embed an underspecified API type they do not control. \n Instead
                  of using this type, create a locally provided and used type that
                  is well-focused on your reference. For example, ServiceReferences
                  for admission registration: https://github.com/kubernetes/api/blob/release-1.17/admissionregistration/v1/types.go#L533

                      field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2].
                      For example, if the object reference is to a container within
                      a pod, this would take on a value like: "spec.containers{name}"
                      (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered

                          uses of this type are discouraged because of difficulty
                          describing its usage when embedded in APIs. 1. Ignored fields.
                          \ It includes many fields which are not generally honored.
                          \ For instance, ResourceVersion and FieldPath are both very
                          rarely valid in actual usage. 2. Invalid usage help.  It
                          is impossible to add specific help for individual usage.
                          \ In most embedded usages, there are particular restrictions
                          like, \"must refer only to types A and B\" or \"UID not
                          honored\" or \"name must be restricted\". Those cannot be
                          well described when embedded. 3. Inconsistent validation.
                          \ Because the usages are different, the validation rules
                          are different by usage, which makes it hard for users to
                          predict what will happen. 4. The fields are both imprecise
                          and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise mapping to a
                          URL. This can produce ambiguity during interpretation and
                          require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency is
                          on the group,resource tuple and the version of the actual
                          struct is irrelevant. 5. We cannot easily change it.  Because
                          this type is embedded in many locations, updates to this

                  are discouraged because of difficulty describing its usage when
                  embedded in APIs. 1. Ignored fields.  It includes many fields which
                  are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion and FieldPath
                  are both very rarely valid in actual usage. 2. Invalid usage help.
                  \ It is impossible to add specific help for individual usage.  In
                  most embedded usages, there are particular restrictions like, \"must
                  refer only to types A and B\" or \"UID not honored\" or \"name must
                  be restricted\". Those cannot be well described when embedded. 3.
                  Inconsistent validation.  Because the usages are different, the
                  validation rules are different by usage, which makes it hard for
                  users to predict what will happen. 4. The fields are both imprecise
                  and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise mapping to a URL. This
                  can produce ambiguity during interpretation and require a REST mapping.
                  \ In most cases, the dependency is on the group,resource tuple and
                  the version of the actual struct is irrelevant. 5. We cannot easily
                  change it.  Because this type is embedded in many locations, updates
                  to this type will affect numerous schemas.  Don't make new APIs
                  embed an underspecified API type they do not control. \n Instead
                  of using this type, create a locally provided and used type that
                  is well-focused on your reference. For example, ServiceReferences
                  for admission registration: https://github.com/kubernetes/api/blob/release-1.17/admissionregistration/v1/types.go#L533

                      field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2].
                      For example, if the object reference is to a container within
                      a pod, this would take on a value like: "spec.containers{name}"
                      (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered
                      the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]"
                      (container with index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen

                      an object. TODO: this design is not final and this field is
